# Tasks: Add Astro Blog

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-add-astro-blog/`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

- [ ] T001 Initialize project dependencies in package.json (package.json)
- [ ] T002 [P] Create `src/styles/` structure and add `src/styles/global.scss`
- [ ] T003 [P] Add Sass devDependency and update `package.json` scripts (package.json)
- [ ] T004 [P] Create `.editorconfig` and basic formatting rules (repository root)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

- [ ] T005 Create base layout `src/layouts/Base.astro`
- [ ] T006 [P] Create `src/components/Header.astro`
- [ ] T007 [P] Create `src/components/Footer.astro`
- [ ] T008 [P] Create `src/components/PostCard.astro`
- [ ] T009 [P] Create `src/components/Pagination.astro`
- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Add Markdown posts to `src/content/posts/*.md` (migrate from `starter-code/data.json`)
- [ ] T011 [P] Create content collection schema `src/content/collections.ts` (post frontmatter types)

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Content & Pagination (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Provide a paginated blog index and per-article pages powered by Markdown content collections.

**Independent Test**: Build the site and verify `/blog/page/1` shows up to 10 posts and `/blog/[slug]` renders the article.

- [ ] T012 [US1] Create `src/pages/blog/page/[page].astro` (paginated index pages)
- [ ] T013 [US1] Create `src/pages/blog/[slug].astro` (per-article page)
- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement `src/pages/blog.astro` to redirect or render first page (`/blog` → `/blog/page/1`)
- [ ] T015 [P] [US1] Implement pagination logic in `src/components/Pagination.astro`
- [ ] T016 [US1] Wire collection data into pages (use `src/content/posts/*.md` and `src/content/collections.ts`)

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Homepage Highlights (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Build the homepage showing an intro and 5 highlighted articles plus a "View all articles" link.

**Independent Test**: Visit `/` and confirm there are 5 highlighted posts and a link to `/blog`.

- [ ] T017 [US2] Create `src/pages/index.astro` with intro and latest 5 posts
- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Ensure `src/components/PostCard.astro` is usable by the homepage

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - About, Newsletter & Footer (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Add static `/about` and `/newsletter` pages and a footer with social icons and the exact text.

**Independent Test**: Visit `/about`, `/newsletter`, and verify footer displays "Made with ❤️ and ☕️" and social links with accessible labels.

- [ ] T019 [US3] Create `src/pages/about.astro`
- [ ] T020 [US3] Create `src/pages/newsletter.astro`
- [ ] T021 [US3] Implement `src/components/Footer.astro` using images from `starter-code/assets/images/` and include aria-labels

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ ] T022 [P] Run `npm install` and verify `npm run dev` (project root)
- [ ] T023 Run `npm run build` and verify static output (project root)
- [ ] T024 [P] Add README updates and quickstart verification `specs/001-add-astro-blog/quickstart.md`

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- Setup (Phase 1) must complete before Foundational (Phase 2).
- Foundational tasks must complete before User Story phases.
- User Story phases (US1, US2, US3) can proceed in parallel after Foundation is ready.

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

- `T002`, `T003`, `T006`, `T007`, `T008`, `T009`, `T011` can run in parallel — they touch different files and don't block each other.
- Once foundational tasks complete, `US1`, `US2`, and `US3` tasks can be worked on concurrently by different developers.

## Implementation Strategy

- MVP scope: Complete Phase 1, Phase 2, and **Phase 3 (US1)** only — this yields a working blog with paginated index and article pages.
- Incremental delivery: After US1 demo, implement US2 (homepage highlights), then US3 (about/newsletter/footer), then polish.

## Validation: Checklist Format

- All tasks in this file follow the required checklist format: `- [ ] T### [P?] [US?] Description with file path`.
